Use
https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/select-features.html
or
https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/box-selection.html
instead of Extent Interaction to select features.


Clean up selection of Interaction Extent (rectangular region to
display all activities from that region).  Remove pointer (and
rectangle) when inactive?

Allow a specific URL request with a date parameter to load only the
activity (or activities) from that date.

Have a separate "playback" URL which loads activities in order with
some soft of configurable delay.

Add a location search bar at the top or bottom of the window to allow
entering a street address or city search that will reposition the map
view.

Add a progress indicator of some sort.  Perhaps something similar to:
https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/image-load-events.html?q=projection.

Figure out a way to draw activities as an animated track from start
to finish.

Tree View of activities timeline (right side) by year, month, date

GPX plots from Runkeeper activities that "auto-pause" can have a
rendering that draws a straight line from one pause point to the next.
Create a script that fixes that?

For efficiency of browsing, may need to consider running a custom
gis server that serves up the relevant activities in a map view by
URL request.

Each point in a gpx plot's multi-line geometry actually contains
4 values: lat, lon, elevation, and time ("M"), so there could be
code like this:

//let firstCoord = features[i].getGeometry().getFirstCoordinate();
//if (firstCoord.length == 4) {
//  var date = new Date(firstCoord[3]*1000);
//  console.log("date: " + date.getFullYear() + "-" + (date.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + date.getDate() +
//    "-" + date.getHours() + "-" + date.getMinutes() + "-" + date.getSeconds())
//}
