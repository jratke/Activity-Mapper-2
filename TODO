Clean up selection of Interaction Extent (rectangular region to
display all activities from that region).  Remove pointer (and
rectangle) when inactive?

Add a location description (city & state), to each timeline entry by
searching the first/last coordinate of the activity.  Maybe query this
info once separately.

Allow a specific URL request with a date parameter to load only the
activity (or activities) from that date.

Have a separate "playback" URL which loads activities in order with
some soft of configurable delay.

Add a location search bar at the top or bottom of the window to allow
entering a street address or city search that will reposition the map
view.


Add a progress indicator of some sort.  Perhaps something similar to:

Figure out a way to draw activities as an animated track from start
to finish.

Tree View of activities timeline (right side) by year, month, date

GPX plots from Runkeeper activities that "auto-pause" can have a
rendering that draws a straight line from one pause point to the next.
Create a script that fixes that?

For efficiency of browsing, may need to consider running a custom
gis server that serves up the relevant activities in a map view by
URL request.
