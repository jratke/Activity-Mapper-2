When selecting an activity by clicking on the map, also hightlight
that activity in the activity timeline view on the right hand panel.

Figure out a way to draw activities as an animated track from start
to finish.

Tree View of activities timeline (right side) by year, month, date

GPX plots from Runkeeper activities that "auto-pause" can have a
rendering that draws a straight line from one pause point to the next.
Create a script that fixes that?

Add a location search bar at the top or bottom of the window to allow
entering a street address or city search that will reposition the map
view.

For efficiency of browsing, may need to consider running a custom
gis server that serves up the relevant activities in a map view by
URL request.
